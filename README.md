## This is the backend code for our app
- I have used Mongodb and Redis as database and NodeJS as the language
- This is hosted in Heroku
- You can view the data stored by pasting the unique id in the link `https://electrovoteapp.herokuapp.com/polls/uniqueid` you will receive after creating the poll
